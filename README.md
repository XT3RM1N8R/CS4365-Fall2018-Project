#### Planning: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/OclAbGlx/se-ii-game)
A majority of the task planning and some of the decision-making can be seen on the Trello board, especially in the “Done” list. Some of the cards had to be archived due to a few reasons that made them unfit, but most of the relevant information has been preserved.

#### This Repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/XT3RM1N8R/CS4365-Fall2018-Project)
We were not able to provide a full-build of the project, but almost all of our relevant source code can be found here.

#### Design Documents & Other Files: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MiyBdC0xs7kolsOUhb1CK0VfPtpxLmYL)
You may this folder as a ZIP file; however, it is highly recommended that you instead view the Google Document format versions on the cloud instead, as these contain our comment history and such and might provide additional insight or information. Regardless, the local format versions can be viewed by downloading the entire folder as a ZIP file, for convenience.
